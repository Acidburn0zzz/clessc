* Introduction

This is a LESS CSS compiler written in C++.

A LESS CSS compiler compiles stylesheets in the LESS format to
CSS. Read more on http://lesscss.org/ 

* Differences from the original compiler

This compiler does not apply formatting to the code. The CSS in the
output contains no whitespace except where necessary. If you need it
to be user-readable you can use a CSS formatter. Try CSSTidy:
http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/

CSS comments are not included in the output. The purpose of this
compiler is to produce the smallest amount of output as possible. 

Parentheses are not required in compound values:

border: @width * 2 solid black;

The spin() function produces slightly different results.

* Installation

To compile just run 'make'. g++ or another c++ compiler is required. If
you are using a compiler other than g++ you'll need to change the
Makefile.

After compiling you will have the binary lessc. You can run 'make
install' as root to install the binary to /local/bin/.

Note that the original compiler is also named lessc. If you already
have another LESS CSS compiler installed you should rename the lessc
binary you just created before copying.

* Usage

To compile the LESS stylesheet stylesheet.less and write the resulting
CSS to stylsheet.css run:

lessc stylesheet.less > stylesheet.css

or:

lessc stylesheet.less -o stylesheet.css
