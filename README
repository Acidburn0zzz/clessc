* Introduction

The LESS CSS compiler compiles stylesheet in the LESS stylesheet
language to CSS. Read more on http://lesscss.org/

* Differences from the original compiler

This compiler does not apply formatting to the code. The CSS in the
output contains no whitespace except where necessary. If you need it
to be user-readable you can use a CSS formatter. Try CSSTidy:
http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/

CSS comments are not included in the output. The purpose of this
compiler is to produce the smallest amount of output as possible. 

Parentheses are not required in compound values:

border: @width * 2 solid black;

The spin() function produces slightly different results.

* Installation

To compile just run make. g++ or another c++ compiler is required. If
you are using a compiler other than g++ you'll need to change the
Makefile.

After compiling you will have the binary lessc. You can copy this to
/usr/local/bin/ or wherever you prefer to have your binaries.

Note that the original compiler is also named lessc. If you already
have another LESS CSS compiler installed you should rename the lessc
binary you just created before copying.

* Usage

To compile the LESS stylesheet stylesheet.less and write the resulting
CSS to stylsheet.css run:

lessc stylesheet.less > stylesheet.css
